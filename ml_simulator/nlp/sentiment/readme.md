## Sentiment analysis + Negation test

- BERT based sentiment analysis model without fine-tuning
- Negation test: a method used to assess the performance of sentiment analysis models. It involves introducing or removing negations in sentences to evaluate how well the model handles them. For instance, in the sentence 'I do not like this product,' the word 'not' is removed, and the test checks if the model correctly changes the sentiment from positive to negative.
