    "# Final project of Dynamic pricing module of Hard ML specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "Build a dynamic pricing service for 1,000 products aimed at profit maximisation. The service is tested on a sales simulator, that models 29 days sales / buying activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a single SKU (product) the task can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{u}\\left(\\sum_{d}S_{u,d}\\cdot\\left(P_{d}(\\theta) - C_{d} \\right) + B\\cdot I[\\sum_{d}S_{u,d}\\geq S\\_{plan}]\\right) \\to \\max_{p(\\cdot)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u$, $d$ - user, day\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{d}(\\theta)$ - price of the SKU on the day $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta$ - pricing factors\n",
    "\n",
    "$S_{u,d}$ - amount of the product, bought by the user $u$ on the day $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{d}$ - the product cost on the day $d$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$S\\_{plan}$, $B$ - sales plan and back bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "None: there may be new customers; there is no cannibalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "Synthetic data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical transactions\n",
    "- Sales plan / back bonuses\n",
    "- Cost prices\n",
    "- Promo actions\n",
    "- Some competitors prices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "The main aim of the project was to experiment with dynamic pricing approaches that I know of:\n",
    "- Price modelling over demand \n",
    "- Using an RL model \n",
    "### Price modelling over demand \n",
    "##### Approach:\n",
    "On the first step, using historical or experimental data, one tries to fit a product demand function as a regression on price and some other factors: $D_{SKU}(p, \\theta)$, after that for each time period the optimal price can be determined by solving the profit (or some other objective) optimization problem: $p\\cdot D_{SKU}(p, \\theta)\\to \\max_{p}$\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "At the preliminary stage, I tried [to cluster](./notebooks/EDA.ipynb) all products (SKU) time series. Then on the main step I fitted a gradient boosting model for each cluster, after that for each SKU / week determined the optimal price by using [bayesian optimization](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/auto_examples/bayesian-optimization.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RL model: contextual bandits\n",
    "##### Approach:\n",
    "By this approach an RL algorithm tries to learn to determine the optimal price from available price strategies, based on particular context (product and user features) and a cost function.\n",
    "##### Solution:\n",
    "I used LaunchpadAI [implementation](https://github.com/LaunchpadAI/space-bandits) of contextual bandits. Context vector is discussed [here](./notebooks/EDA.ipynb). By setting reward function, besides the profit component, I tried to stimulate fulfillment of the sales plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{d} - C_{d} + \\dfrac{B}{S\\_{plan} - S\\_{cum\\_d}}\\cdot I[b_{0} < r_{d} < b_{1}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{d}$, $C_{d}$ price and cost of the product on day $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "$S\\_{cum\\_d}=\\sum_{d-1}S_{d}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{d}$ - sales dynamic: \n",
    "$$r_{d} = \\dfrac{29}{(d-1)\\cdot S\\_{plan}}\\cdot S\\_{cum\\_d}  $$\n",
    "$b_{0}$, $b_{1}$ - low and upper bounds, $b_{1}=1.01$, $b_{0}$ - a kind of sigmoid function on $d$\n",
